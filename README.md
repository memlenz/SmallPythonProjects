# Python Projects

This repository contains some small Python projects and scripts that help me practice and apply what I've learned. Feel free to download, use, or improve them!

## Projects

- Project 1: bagels.py, you have to guess a random number using clues
- Project 2: bulletPointAdder.py, can uniform a list using clipboard for copiying the content and paste it

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, simply use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
